android-asset-copier
====================

Copy drawables from a zipped package on to your android project tree.

Inspiration
--------------

I have used the [Android Asset Studio](http://romannurik.github.io/AndroidAssetStudio/index.html) a lot (for now it has been for my personal projects) and I find myself following a particular routine:

* Choose asset category and edit choice as desired
* Download asset zipped packged.
* Extract and do a copy of each asset item to my IDE (Eclispe mostly)
 
I have to say I find this sort of thing cumbersome/tedious so I created a quick Java application to do the job for me. I no longer need to extract zipped packages. The application allows me to download as many asset packs as I like and handle (transfer each asset to approprite folders) all in one click.

It occurred to me recently that another developer might like it. Perhaps a similar app exists.
